There are two requirements for the crack1 challenge.

First, step through the code in the debugger and determine how to satisfy the license, and make it happen.

For the first step, you may create a license file that makes the program work.


For the second step, you must modify the executable so that it runs
without the license file.  This will require that you identify where
the program branches based on the results from the license file, and
change the code so that it always behaves as though the license were
correct.

You will have to identify the byte(s) in the program that must be changed, then using hexedit:



and an ARMv6 instruction manual: https://static.docs.arm.com/ddi0419/d/DDI0419D_armv6m_arm.pdf
you will figure out what hex bytes to replace, and then replace them using hexedit.

g++ -g patch.c -o patch
./patch patch.txt a.out b.out
